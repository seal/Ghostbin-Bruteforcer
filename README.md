# Ghostbin-Bruteforcer
Proxyless ghostbin bruteforcer written in GoLang


Will be adding:
  Proxy support

Broken things:
Random checking doesn't check if the URL has been checked before, therefore making it ineffecient for long checks

Custom start point only works for up to "jjjjj", will fix soon
